# MatchApp

 This app was made as a part of the Code with Chris youtube learning series, with an altered search function that allowed for better performance. The link can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMRqhzcHGw1YdahNsCLZdSVfNv0stwvdx. 

The search function I used for the matching card selection on the board used read-write bindings for better performance.  The match app displays a simple card matching game with 16 cards. The game has a time limit, and if all cards are tapped on by the user before the end of the time limit a winning message is presented using the UIAlertController, UIKit class. Otherwise, a losing message is presented. The app uses the collection view delegate and protocal methods in the UIKit, as well as a timer with timing functionality.
