# MatchApp

The match app displays a simple card matching game with 16 cards. The 16 cards have a set of 8 pictures, and two cards share each picture. If two cards of the same pciture are chosen, these cards are eliminated from the board. The game has a time limit, and if all cards are eliminated from the board before the time limit the user has won the game. Otherwise, a losing message is presented. The app uses the collection view delegate and protocal methods in the UIKit, as well as a timer with timer methods. This app was made as a part of the Code with Chris youtube learning series, the link can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMRqhzcHGw1YdahNsCLZdSVfNv0stwvdx
